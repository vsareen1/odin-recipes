    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Lasagna is the ultimate comfort food—a hearty, layered dish that brings together rich flavors and satisfying textures in every bite. 
       This classic Italian recipe is a favorite for family dinners, gatherings, or meal prep. With layers of tender pasta, a flavorful meat sauce, 
       creamy béchamel, and melted cheese, it's a dish that feels like a warm hug. Whether you're making it for a Sunday lunch or storing it for the week, 
       lasagna holds its own as both delicious and filling.</p>
    <p>This recipe keeps things traditional but straightforward. It uses a rich tomato-meat sauce, smooth béchamel for creaminess, and a blend of mozzarella
       and Parmesan for that golden top layer. Every component can be made ahead of time, making it a great option for busy home cooks. Once baked, the layers
       meld beautifully, creating a dish that's as beautiful to serve as it is tasty to eat.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>For the meat sauce</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1 medium onion, chopped</li>
        <li>2 garlic cloves, minced</li>
        <li>500g ground beef (or half beef, half pork)</li>
        <li>400g canned crushed tomatoes</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons tomato paste</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>Fresh basil (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>For the béchamel sauce</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 cups milk (preferably warm)</li>
        <li>Salt and a pinch of nutmeg</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Other ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>9-12 lasagna noodles (pre-cooked or oven-ready)</li>
        <li>2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>½ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Make the Meat Sauce: Heat olive oil in a pan, sauté onions until soft, then add garlic. Stir in ground beef and cook until browned. Add crushed tomatoes,
            tomato paste, oregano, salt, and pepper. Simmer for 20-30 minutes until thickened. Add basil if using.</li>
        <li>Prepare the Béchamel Sauce: In a saucepan, melt butter, add flour, and whisk until a paste forms (about 1 minute).
            Slowly pour in warm milk while whisking continuously. Cook until the sauce thickens. Season with salt and a pinch of nutmeg.</li>
        <li>Preheat the Oven: Preheat your oven to 180°C (350°F).</li>
        <li>Assemble the Lasagna: In a baking dish, start with a spoonful of meat sauce at the bottom. Layer noodles, then more meat sauce, 
            a layer of béchamel, and a sprinkle of cheese. Repeat the layers, finishing with béchamel and a generous topping of mozzarella and Parmesan.</li>
        <li>Bake: Cover with foil and bake for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 15-20 minutes until the top is golden and bubbly.</li>
        <li>Cool and Serve: Let the lasagna rest for 10-15 minutes before slicing. This helps the layers set and makes serving easier.</li>
    </ol>
